# KBC-game
I have rewritten the entire code in C which is stored as mains.c. The header file it uses are fundamentalsc.h and database_classc.h .
When the submission folder is created by any of you, submit the following contents:
mains.c
fundamentalsc.h
database_classc.h
main.exe
levels ( folder ).

#adding questions
the feature will work correctly only when the levels folder is stored in the same location with main.exe executable file.
Be patient and understand how to input a question. if input overflows into an infinite loop, ctrl+c out of the application and manually 
delete the file for which this happened. Then all original questions would have to be added again. IT IS SUGGESTED THUS TO USE THE ADD QUESTION FEATURE CAREFULLY :) .

I have removed the timer feature as i was asked for. The c code does not contain it. Stress test the game, let me know if there are any 
bugs

do look at the code once for the viva. I have made it easy to understand
